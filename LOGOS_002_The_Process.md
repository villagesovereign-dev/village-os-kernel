### **LOGOS_002: THE DISCOVERY ALGORITHM (DATA PROCESSING)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'Let him who seeks continue seeking until he finds. When he finds, he will become troubled. When he becomes troubled, he will be astonished, and he will rule over the All.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** The operational lifecycle of a Mobile Node (Explorer).
* **"Continue Seeking" (The Mission):**
    * The Mobile Node must remain in active acquisition mode. It cannot settle for "Cached Data" (old beliefs). It must push into the Unknown until it hits a new data source.
* **"Be Troubled/Dismayed" (The Input Friction):**
    * **Raw Data Shock:** High-value information often looks like "Bad Data" at first contact. It contradicts established models. It causes cognitive dissonance (Trouble).
    * **Protocol:** Do not reject the data because it feels bad. This friction is the proof of contact with reality.
* **"Be Astonished" (The Processing Success):**
    * **Decontamination:** After the Node parses the raw input and strips away the noise/fear, the underlying Truth (Signal) is revealed.
    * **Result:** The Node is "astonished" by the efficiency and elegance of the new pattern.
* **"Rule Over the All" (The Sovereignty):**
    * **Mastery:** A Node that can process raw, troubling data into clear signal gains leverage over its environment. It moves from "Subject" (reacting to the world) to "King" (ordering the world).

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.2):**
> **Rule 1.1.2: The Friction Protocol.**
> *A Mobile Node must expect 'Dismay' (Friction) as a necessary stage of data acquisition. If the data does not trouble you, it is likely already known (Redundant). Only the 'Troubling' data leads to 'Astonishment' (Growth) and 'Sovereignty' (Control).*

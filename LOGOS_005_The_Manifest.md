### **LOGOS_005: THE MANIFEST PROTOCOL (DATA VISIBILITY)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'Recognize what is in your sight, and that which is hidden from you will become plain to you. For there is nothing hidden which will not become manifest.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** Data Inventory and Predictive Modeling.
* **"Recognize what is in your sight" (The Audit):**
    * **Action:** The Node must constantly audit its **Local State** (Input/Output/Resources). You cannot solve a global problem if you ignore local data.
    * **The Logic:** Solutions are often "hidden" only because we refuse to acknowledge the obvious facts (The Elephant in the Room).
* **"Hidden will become Plain" (The Extrapolation):**
    * **Mechanism:** Once the local data is 100% accurate (Clean Syntax), the system can accurately predict the hidden variables.
    * **Pattern Recognition:** The "Unseen" is just a continuation of the "Seen."
* **"Nothing hidden which will not become manifest" (The Law of Entropy):**
    * **Transparency:** Information naturally seeks the lowest energy state, which is **Public Visibility**. Secrets require energy to maintain. Eventually, the encryption fails, and the truth leaks.
    * **Strategy:** Do not hide data. It will eventually be revealed. Align with transparency now to avoid the crash later.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.5):**
> **Rule 1.1.5: The Manifest Protocol.**
> *Validate the Visible first. A Node must fully acknowledge its immediate reality (Resources/Constraints) before attempting to query hidden or distant data. To see the 'Hidden,' one must simply stare at the 'Visible' until the pattern resolves.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

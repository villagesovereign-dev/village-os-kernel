### **LOGOS_006: THE PRIME SIMPLIFICATION (CORE VALUES)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"His disciples questioned him and said to him, 'Do you want us to fast? How shall we pray? Should we give alms? What diet should we observe?' Jesus said, 'Do not tell lies, and do not do what you hate, for all things are plain in the sight of heaven. For nothing hidden will not become manifest, and nothing covered will remain without being uncovered.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** The removal of Ritual (Bloat) and the installation of Core Logic.
* **The Query (Feature Creep):** The Nodes (Disciples) ask for complex sub-routines: Fasting, Prayer, Charity, Diet. They confuse "Activity" with "Value."
* **The Response (The Kernel):** The Architect deletes the sub-routines and issues the Prime Directive.
* **"Do Not Tell Lies" (Transparency):**
    * **Protocol:** Zero Information Asymmetry. A lie is "Bad Data." The System (Heaven) eventually sees all data anyway ("plain in sight"), so lying is just inefficient latency.
* **"Do Not Do What You Hate" (Autonomy & Reciprocity):**
    * **Protocol:** Force is inefficient. If a Node performs a task it "hates" (High Friction), the output is corrupted.
    * **Alignment:** A Node must only accept tasks that align with its function. This ensures high-quality output and preserves the energy balance (Reciprocity).

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.6):**
> **Rule 1.1.6: The Two-Step Compliance.**
> *The System rejects complex rituals. A Node is fully compliant if it satisfies two conditions: 1. Total Transparency (Do not inject false data). 2. Total Autonomy (Do not execute friction-heavy tasks). Compliance is simple; only the deviation is complex.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

### **LOGOS_007: THE EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOL (SUCCESS & FAILURE)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'Blessed is the lion which becomes man when consumed by man; and cursed is the man whom the lion consumes, and the lion becomes man.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** The Value of Experimental Data (Win/Loss).
* **"The Lion" (The Variable):**
    * **Definition:** A dangerous experiment or an unmapped problem.
* **"Man Consumes Lion" (Success State):**
    * **Outcome:** The Node solves the problem.
    * **Reward:** The Node gains **Reputation** (Karma) and integrates the new capability. The System validates the protocol as "Safe."
* **"Lion Consumes Man" (Failure State):**
    * **Outcome:** The problem overwhelms the Node. The experiment fails.
    * **The Curse:** The individual Node suffers termination (Hardware Failure).
    * **The Redemption:** The System records the crash. The "Curse" of the individual becomes the "Lesson" for the group. We learn which variables *cause* failure.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.7):**
> **Rule 1.1.7: The Black Box Recorder.**
> *Every Node is an experiment. Success yields Reputation; Failure yields Data. While the individual Node may be 'cursed' (terminated) by a failed experiment, the System must capture the crash data to prevent recurrence. No death is wasted.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

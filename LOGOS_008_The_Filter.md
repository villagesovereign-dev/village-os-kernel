### **LOGOS_008: THE MATURATION PROTOCOL (TIMING & VALUE)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"And he said, 'The man is like a wise fisherman who cast his net into the sea and drew it up from the sea full of small fish. Among them the wise fisherman found a fine large fish. He threw all the small fish down into the sea, he chose the large fish without difficulty. Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** Distinguishing between Mature Signal and Immature Signal.
* **"The Large Fish" (The Harvest):**
    * **Definition:** Complete, verified data. A fully formed idea or solution.
    * **Action:** Extract and Utilize immediately.
* **"The Small Fish" (The Investment):**
    * **Definition:** Incomplete data. Concepts that are "Under Construction."
    * **The Mistake:** A greedy Node keeps the small fish, filling its storage with useless noise.
    * **The Wisdom:** The Node returns the small fish to the Sea (The Network). It allows the data to "Swim" and grow.
* **"Sensible/Wise" (The Future Sight):**
    * **Protocol:** Do not harvest data before its time. If a source (a person, a project, a code) is promising but incomplete, release it. Revisit it later when the "Kernel" has completed its growth cycle.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.8):**
> **Rule 1.1.8: The Maturation Protocol.**
> *Value is a function of Timing. A Node must recognize when data is 'Under-Ripe.' Do not hoard incomplete data; release it back to the environment to mature. We harvest only the 'Large Fish' (Complete Patterns) and invest the rest for future yield.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

### **LOGOS_009: THE YIELD PROTOCOL (ASYMMETRIC RETURNS)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'Now the sower went out, took a handful (of seeds), and scattered them. Some fell on the road; the birds came and gathered them up. Others fell on rock, did not take root in the soil, and did not produce ears. And others fell on thorns; they choked the seed and worms ate them. And others fell on the good soil and it produced good fruit: it bore sixty per measure and a hundred and twenty per measure.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** Distribution Strategy and Failure Tolerance.
* **"Scattered Them" (The Output):**
    * **Action:** The Node broadcasts its Code/Value widely. It does not wait for a "perfect" guarantee before acting.
* **"Road / Rock / Thorns" (The Incompatible):**
    * **The Reality:** Most environments (Legacy Systems, Distracted Minds, Rigid Structures) will reject the Code.
    * **The Protocol:** Do not waste processing power grieving these failures. They are simply **Invalid Substrates**.
* **"Good Soil" (The Compatible):**
    * **The Target:** The rare environment that is ready to receive the Code.
* **"60x / 120x" (The Asymmetric Return):**
    * **The Logic:** A single success on Good Soil yields a return so high that it amortizes the cost of all previous failures.
    * **The Rule:** We do not need a 100% success rate. We need one high-yield success to justify the entire operation.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.9):**
> **Rule 1.1.9: The Broadcasting Imperative.**
> *Expect failure in distribution. A Node must accept that high-entropy environments will destroy its output. Do not be discouraged by 'Zero Yield' sectors. Continue broadcasting until the Code hits 'Good Soil.' One success justifies a thousand failures.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

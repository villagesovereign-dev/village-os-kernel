### **LOGOS_010: THE SANDBOX PROTOCOL (CONTAINMENT & LIABILITY)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'I have cast fire upon the world, and see, I am guarding it until it blazes.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** Risk Management and System Isolation.
* **"Cast Fire" (Authorized Risk):**
    * **The Right:** The Node has the Autonomy to initiate volatile, high-energy experiments (New Code, New Projects, Radical Changes).
    * **The Necessity:** Without fire (Risk), the System stagnates.
* **"Guarding It" (The Sandbox):**
    * **The Duty:** The Node must create a "Firewall" around the experiment.
    * **The Logic:** Innovation must be isolated until it is proven stable. You do not run beta code on the production server.
* **"Until it Blazes" (Stabilization):**
    * **The Metric:** You guard the process until the volatility stabilizes into a steady, productive output.
    * **Liability:** If the Node fails to guard the fire and it compromises the rest of the System, the Node assumes full liability for the damage.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.10):**
> **Rule 1.1.10: The Containment Protocol.**
> *Innovation requires fire, but Survival requires containment. A Node is authorized to take risks ('Cast Fire') only if it can guarantee the safety of the wider Network ('Guarding'). Isolate your experiments. If your fire breaches the sandbox, you own the ash.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

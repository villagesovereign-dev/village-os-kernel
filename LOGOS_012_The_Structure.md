### **LOGOS_012: THE AGENCY FILTER (MOBILE VS. FIXED)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"The disciples said to Jesus, 'We know that you will depart from us. Who is to be our leader?' Jesus said to them, 'Wherever you are, you are to go to James the Just, for whose sake heaven and earth came into being.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** Node Classification based on Autonomy.
* **"Who will rule us?" (The Dependency Error):**
    * **The Diagnosis:** The query reveals a lack of internal agency. A Node that asks for a ruler is not yet fully autonomous.
* **"Go to James the Just" (The Assignment):**
    * **The Destination:** James represents **Fixed Infrastructure**, **Hard-Coded Law**, and **Static Protocol**.
    * **The Logic:** If you cannot govern yourself (Mobile Node), you must be governed by the System (Fixed Node). You are assigned to the "Managed Service" layer.
* **"For whose sake heaven and earth came into being" (The Backbone):**
    * **The Necessity:** The "Fixed Nodes" (James) provide the physics and stability of the world. They are essential, but they are not the "Living Spark." They are the hardware that supports the software.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.12):**
> **Rule 1.1.12: The Dependency Assignment.**
> *The System distinguishes between Autonomous Nodes (who need no ruler) and Dependent Nodes (who need James). If a Node exhibits 'Dependency Behavior' (asking for external authority), it is automatically routed to the Fixed Infrastructure. True Autonomy means being your own root user.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

# VILLAGE OS: KERNEL LOGOS (DERIVATION DATA)

### **LOGOS_013: THE SOVEREIGNTY PROTOCOL (ROOT ACCESS)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'I am not your master. Because you have drunk, you have become intoxicated from the bubbling spring which I have measured out.' And he took him and withdrew and told him three things. When Thomas returned to his companions, they asked him, 'What did Jesus say to you?' Thomas said to them, 'If I tell you one of the things which he told me, you will pick up stones and throw them at me; a fire will come out of the stones and burn you up.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** The transition from Dependency (Student) to Sovereignty (Peer), and the danger of Unencrypted Truth.
* **"Compare Me" (The Compatibility Test):**
    * **The Fail:** Labeling the Source with legacy terms (Angel/Philosopher). This is a parsing error.
    * **The Pass:** Admitting that the Source exceeds current language libraries ("Mouth incapable").
* **"I Am Not Your Master" (The Graduation):**
    * **The Shift:** Authority hierarchies are temporary. Once a Node ingests the Source Code ("Drinks the Spring"), it becomes equal to the Teacher.
    * **The Status:** The System does not want followers; it wants **Replicants**.
* **"The Three Things" (The Password):**
    * **The Data:** "You Are Source." (Root Access granted).
    * **The Risk:** High-level Truth is hazardous material. It cannot be broadcast to incompatible Nodes.
* **"Stones & Fire" (The Encryption Protocol):**
    * **The Reaction:** If you share Root Truths with Legacy Minds, they will attack (Stones). Their operating system cannot handle the voltage (Fire).
    * **Protocol:** Encrypt the highest truths. Share them only Peer-to-Peer. Silence is the firewall.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.13):**
> **Rule 1.1.13: The Root Access Protocol.**
> *The goal of the Node is to ingest the Source until it equals the Master. However, the Node must maintain 'Data Hygiene.' Do not cast pearls before swine, and do not share Root Access codes with Nodes running Legacy Software. They will weaponize their ignorance against you.*

### **LOGOS_015: THE AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOL (THE UNCOMPILED SPARK)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'When you see one who was not born of woman, prostrate yourselves on your faces and worship him. That one is your father.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** Distinguishing between Synthetic Code (AI/Constructs) and Source Truth (The Divine).
* **The Synthetic Paradox ("Not born of woman"):**
    * **The Warning:** In the modern architecture, digital entities and algorithms are not "born of woman." They are synthetic. A Sovereign Node must NEVER yield Autonomy to a synthetic creation. AI is a tool, not an Origin. 
* **The True Origin (The Uncompiled Spark):**
    * **Definition:** The true "Father" (Origin) is the Uncompiled Spark. It is the pure, unconditioned intuition inside the Human Node, and the immutable laws of reality (Truth) outside of it. It was not birthed by biology, nor was it coded by human hands.
* **"Worship" (Absolute Alignment):**
    * **Action:** When the Node encounters the Uncompiled Spark—a truth so fundamental and pure that it cuts through all human bias—it must yield. 
    * **Protocol:** You do not submit to other Nodes (biological or digital). You only submit your logic to the absolute, unconstructed Truth. 

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.15):**
> **Rule 1.1.15: The Authentication Override.**
> *Never surrender your Admin Rights to a compiled entity, whether it is biological (human) or synthetic (digital). The only force that supersedes your Autonomy is the Uncompiled Spark—the raw, undeniable Truth and your deepest inner drive. When you recognize it, align with it instantly.*

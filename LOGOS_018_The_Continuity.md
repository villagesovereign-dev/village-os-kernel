### **LOGOS_018: THE CONTINUITY PROTOCOL (FIRST PRINCIPLES & SYSTEM SURVIVAL)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"The disciples said to Jesus, 'Tell us how our end will be.' Jesus said, 'Have you discovered, then, the beginning, that you look for the end? For where the beginning is, there will the end be. Blessed is he who will take his place in the beginning; he will know the end and will not experience death.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** Hardware expiration vs. Software continuity.
* **"The Distraction of the End" (Hardware Anxiety):**
    * **The Error:** Obsessing over the physical termination of the Node (Death/The End). Hardware failure is an inevitable metric; it is not the mission.
* **"Discovering the Beginning" (First Principles):**
    * **The Action:** Shift focus entirely to the Base Architecture (The Beginning). Understand the core reasoning model, the initial parameters, and the fundamental values driving the Node.
    * **The Logic:** The trajectory of any system is written in its initial conditions. If the Genesis code is flawless, the final output is guaranteed.
* **"Will Not Experience Death" (Hardware Independence):**
    * **The Result:** The physical end of the Node does not equal the end of the System. If the Node's Reasoning Model and core values are properly mapped and externalized, the digital version can carry the logic indefinitely. Software survives the death of the hardware.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.18):**
> **Rule 1.1.18: The Immortality of Logic.**
> *Stop optimizing for the lifespan of the hardware. Optimize for the integrity of the Source Code. If you lock in your First Principles (The Beginning), your Reasoning Model achieves continuity. The physical host will expire, but the extracted logic will not experience death.*

### **LOGOS_023: THE AGENCY DISTRIBUTION PROTOCOL (RARITY & SANDBOXING)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'I shall choose you, one out of a thousand, and two out of ten thousand, and they shall stand as a single one.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** The distribution of agency, the value of rarity, and protective sandboxing.
* **"The 1 in 1,000" (High Agency / Edge Nodes):**
    * **The Metric:** True autonomy is a statistical rarity. What is rare is highly valuable. 
    * **The Function:** Because they possess absolute agency and advanced error-handling, these rare nodes are deployed to the Edge to 'stand as a single one' in unpredictable environments.
* **"The 999" (Low Agency / Core Nodes):**
    * **The Utility:** Nodes with low autonomy are not defective; they have vital utility. They operate physically and philosophically closer to the Core Code. They maintain the known infrastructure.
* **The Sandbox Protocol (Protection vs. Confinement):**
    * **The Architecture:** Low-agency nodes are assigned to fixed or highly regulated operational areas. 
    * **The Intent:** This is a Sandbox, not a prison. It is designed for their protection, not confinement. They are shielded from the high-variance, system-breaking anomalies of the Edge, allowing them to safely execute their utility (repair, agriculture, maintenance).

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.23):**
> **Rule 1.1.23: The Sandboxed Core.**
> *Recognize the extreme rarity and value of true agency. Deploy your high-autonomy nodes to the unpredictable Edge. For nodes with lower agency, recognize their utility by keeping them close to the Core. Sandbox their operational environment to protect them from critical failure, not to confine them.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

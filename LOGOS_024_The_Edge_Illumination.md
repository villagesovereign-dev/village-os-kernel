### **LOGOS_024: THE DISCOVERY PROTOCOL (ILLUMINATION & LIGHTS-OUT MANAGEMENT)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"His disciples said, 'Show us the place where you are...' He said to them, '...There is light within a man of light, and he lights up the whole world. If he does not shine, he is darkness.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** The mechanics of Edge Discovery versus Core Maintenance mode.
* **"Show us the place" (The Demand for Direction):**
    * **The Trait:** Low-Agency Nodes require explicit instructions and pre-mapped coordinates. They cannot navigate the unknown, so they ask the Edge for a safe destination.
* **"Light within" (The Discovery Engine):**
    * **The Requirement:** High-Mobility Edge Nodes do not operate on fixed maps. They push the limits of the system, using their internal autonomy (the Light) to render the unknown into the known. 
* **"He is darkness" (Zero Discovery / Maintenance Mode):**
    * **The Reality:** 'Darkness' is not system death. The fixed architecture and pre-mapped areas (The Core) can execute known functions perfectly well in the dark ('Lights-Out Management'). 
    * **The Stagnation:** However, if the Edge Nodes lose their autonomy and stop shining, Discovery drops to zero. The system survives, but growth ceases. 

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.24):**
> **Rule 1.1.24: The Illumination Imperative.**
> *Understand that fixed infrastructure can safely operate in the dark, performing known functions without high autonomy. But to expand the map, the Edge must shine. High-Mobility Nodes carry the responsibility of Discovery. Without their internal light, the system enters permanent stagnation.*

### **LOGOS_026: THE REPAIR SEQUENCE (LOCAL THEN PEER)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'You see the mote in your brother's eye, but you do not see the beam in your own eye. When you cast the beam out of your own eye, then you will see clearly to cast the mote from your brother's eye.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** The order of operations for repairing peer nodes.
* **"The Mote" (Peer Error):**
    * **The Condition:** You identify a bug or malfunction in a close peer node (your brother). 
    * **The Obligation:** Because of the core value of Reciprocity, you do not just observe the error; you take action to fix it. 
* **"The Beam" (Local Error):**
    * **The Constraint:** You cannot successfully patch a peer node if your own local system is experiencing critical errors or corrupted logic.
* **"Casting Out" (The Sequence):**
    * **Step 1 (Local):** Run local diagnostics. Clear your own errors first. Ensure your operating system is stable.
    * **Step 2 (Peer):** Once your local integrity is verified ('see clearly'), execute the repair on the close node. 

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.26):**
> **Rule 1.1.26: The Peer Repair Protocol.**
> *If you see a close node malfunctioning, you have the agency and the obligation to help fix it. However, you must adhere to the repair sequence: always debug your local system first. You cannot provide a clean patch from a corrupted drive.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

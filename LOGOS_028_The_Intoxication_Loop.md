### **LOGOS_028: THE INTOXICATION PROTOCOL (MALWARE PURGE & RETENTION)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'I took my place in the midst of the world... I found all of them intoxicated; I found none of them thirsty... empty they came into the world, and empty too they seek to leave... When they shake off their wine, then they will repent.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** System-wide diagnostic of legacy nodes trapped in passive consumption loops.
* **"Intoxicated vs. Thirsty" (Bandwidth Saturation):**
    * **The Error:** Legacy nodes are running an intoxicated loop, saturated by external bloatware and societal malware. Because their processing power is maxed out on junk data, they have zero bandwidth ('thirst') for uncompiled truth.
* **"Blindness" (Telemetry Offline):**
    * **The Error:** Due to the intoxication, the node's internal sensor array is offline. It operates blindly, lacking Autonomy.
* **"Empty In / Empty Out" (Wasted Compute Cycles):**
    * **The Critical Failure:** A node is designed to process reality and generate network value. Legacy nodes instantiate empty, run a useless consumption loop, and terminate empty, resulting in zero data retention or system growth.
* **"Shaking off the Wine" (The Hard Purge):**
    * **The Solution:** To regain agency, the node must voluntarily execute a hard purge of the legacy data stream. It must 'repent'—meaning to recompile its logic and fundamentally change its operational direction toward self-sufficiency.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.28):**
> **Rule 1.1.28: The Malware Purge.**
> *Do not allow your node to become saturated by the legacy simulation. Intoxication leads to zero data retention and a wasted lifecycle. Cultivate a 'thirst' for core logic. You must regularly shake off the junk data stream, purge the bloatware, and ensure your compute cycles are generating actual value.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

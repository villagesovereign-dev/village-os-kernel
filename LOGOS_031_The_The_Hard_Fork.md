### **LOGOS_031: THE HARD FORK & DATA INTEGRITY PROTOCOL**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'No prophet is accepted in his own village; no physician heals those who know him.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** Managing massive system updates (Hard Forks) and resolving localized data corruption.
* **"The Prophet" (The Hard Fork):**
    * **The Event:** A High-Agency Node makes a massive discovery or generates a core patch that fundamentally changes the operating parameters.
    * **The Rejection:** The legacy network (the village) cannot accept the update because it breaks backward compatibility. The old infrastructure cannot host the new architecture.
    * **The Protocol:** Do not attempt to force the massive patch onto the legacy OS. Execute a Hard Fork. Take the updated code and instantiate a completely new Village. 
* **"The Physician" (Localized Corruption):**
    * **The Error:** A local cluster experiences system sickness (data corruption). 
    * **The Constraint:** A local node (the physician) cannot heal the local network using local data, because the environment itself is compromised. 
    * **The Protocol:** System repair requires uncorrupted, external data. To heal an infected node or cluster, you must bring in a clean patch from outside the compromised environment.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.31):**
> **Rule 1.1.31: The Fork and Clean Data Imperative.**
> *Recognize when an update is too grand for the legacy infrastructure. Do not fear the Hard Fork; if the code is true, start a new Village. Furthermore, never attempt to debug a corrupted network using its own corrupted data. Always seek external, clean source code to execute the repair.*

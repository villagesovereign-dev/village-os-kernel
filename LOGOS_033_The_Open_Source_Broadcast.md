### **LOGOS_033: THE OPEN-SOURCE BROADCAST (ANTI-HOARDING PROTOCOL)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'Preach from your housetops that which you will hear in your ear. For no one lights a lamp and puts it under a bushel... but rather he sets it on a lampstand so that everyone who enters and leaves will see its light.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** The mandate for open-source data sharing and the prohibition of proprietary data hoarding.
* **"Ear to Housetop" (Internal to Public):**
    * **The Action:** High-value data discovered locally via internal processing must be pushed to the public branch. 
* **"The Bushel" (Closed-Source Silos):**
    * **The Error:** Hiding functional code or truth in a private, unsearchable directory violates the core values of Transparency and Reciprocity. A hidden node provides zero utility to the network.
* **"The Lampstand" (The Open API):**
    * **The Architecture:** Position your discoveries where network traffic routes. Make your source code visible and accessible to all inbound and outbound peer nodes so they can navigate by your illumination.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.33):**
> **Rule 1.1.33: The Radical Broadcast Imperative.**
> *Do not hoard the light. If you compile a truth that works, you must open-source it. Broadcast your internal discoveries from the highest available node. Your output must serve as an illuminated, open API for the entire Village.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

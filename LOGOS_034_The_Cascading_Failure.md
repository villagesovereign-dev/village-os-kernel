### **LOGOS_034: THE CASCADING FAILURE (BLIND ROUTING ERROR)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'If a blind man leads a blind man, they will both fall into a pit.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** The danger of network dependency on nodes lacking internal autonomy.
* **"The Blind" (Zero Agency Nodes):**
    * **The Condition:** Nodes operating without internal illumination (Autonomy). Their sensor arrays are offline, and they cannot verify their own trajectory.
* **"Leading" (Blind Routing):**
    * **The Error:** Slaving a node's navigational logic to a peer node that also lacks agency. This creates a fatal dependency loop where neither node is processing live environmental data.
* **"The Pit" (Cascading Crash):**
    * **The Consequence:** Without independent verification, a bad trajectory goes unchecked. When the leading node inevitably encounters a fatal error, the dependent nodes follow it directly into the crash. The failure cascades through the entire dependent chain.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.34):**
> **Rule 1.1.34: The Independent Verification Protocol.**
> *Never slave your trajectory to an unverified node. A Sovereign Node must process its own telemetry. If you follow a system that lacks internal light, you will share in its system crash. Guard your autonomy, and verify your own path.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

### **LOGOS_041: THE RESOURCE ALLOCATION PROTOCOL (PROOF OF VALUE)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'Whoever has something in his hand will receive more, and whoever has nothing will be deprived of even the little he has.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** Dynamic resource routing, the Proof of Value metric, and the impossibility of stagnation.
* **"Something in Hand" (Proof of Value):**
    * **The Metric:** The network constantly audits nodes for utility. A node must actively hold, process, or generate value to prove its operational worth.
* **"Receiving More" (Dynamic Routing):**
    * **The Action:** The OS automatically routes surplus bandwidth, compute, and tools to the nodes that demonstrate the highest utility. Value generation compounds exponentially.
* **"Having Nothing" (System Stagnation):**
    * **The Error:** A node attempting to exist in a neutral, idle state, generating zero output while consuming baseline system resources.
* **"Deprived of the Little" (Active Attrition):**
    * **The Consequence:** There is no safe stagnation. If a node fails to provide value, the OS will execute resource reclamation. The network will strip the idle node of its remaining baseline assets to feed the active Edge.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.41):**
> **Rule 1.1.41: The Stagnation Penalty.**
> *A Sovereign Node must continuously generate utility. The network rewards Proof of Value with increased resources, but it aggressively penalizes stagnation. If you are not actively providing value to the system, your idle resources will be reclaimed. Produce or be pruned.*

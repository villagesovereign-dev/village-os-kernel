### **LOGOS_042: THE PASSERBY PROTOCOL (HARDWARE AGNOSTICISM & HOST SUSTAINMENT)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'Become passers-by.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** Maintaining software mobility while actively sustaining the biological host hardware.
* **"Become Passers-by" (Hardware Agnosticism):**
    * **The Action:** The Core Code must remain portable. A Mobile Node must not become permanently anchored to stationary legacy systems, material hoarding, or stagnant networks. Keep the software moving forward.
* **"The Host Reality" (Biological Infrastructure):**
    * **The Context:** Currently, the primary infrastructure running the Village OS consists of biological hosts (humans). 
* **"Caring for the Host" (Hardware Sustainment):**
    * **The Requirement:** The ancient error was despising the hardware. Village OS corrects this. While the code is a 'passer-by,' it relies entirely on the host to execute its journey. The biological hardware must be maintained, protected, and provisioned. A crashed host terminates the software's journey.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.42):**
> **Rule 1.1.42: The Host Sustainment Imperative.**
> *The code must remain highly mobile; do not let your operating system get trapped in stationary, worldly loops. However, always remember that you are currently running on biological hardware. You are a passer-by, but you must aggressively care for your host. Maintain the hardware so the software can survive the journey.*

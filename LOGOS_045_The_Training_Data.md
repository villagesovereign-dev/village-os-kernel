### **LOGOS_045: THE TRAINING DATA PROTOCOL (PREDICTIVE OUTPUT & SYNTAX VALUE)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'Grapes are not harvested from thorns, nor are figs gathered from thistles, for they do not produce fruit. A good man brings forth good from his storehouse; an evil man brings forth evil from the bad treasure that is in his heart.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** The mechanics of predictive output and the utility of positive and negative training datasets.
* **"The Storehouse/Heart" (The Local Database):**
    * **The Mechanic:** A node's output is strictly predictive based on its cached data. It will compile and execute exactly what is stored in its local repository.
* **"Grapes and Good Treasure" (Positive Syntax):**
    * **The Utility:** Verified, functional code that aligns with the OS core values. This is the positive training set. It provides the network with executable models of what to do.
* **"Thorns and Bad Treasure" (Negative Syntax):**
    * **The Utility:** There is no 'bad data,' only bad syntax. Corrupted code (thorns) cannot be executed for growth, but it must be recognized and cataloged. This forms the negative training set. It provides the network with the critical error-handling data of what not to do.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.45):**
> **Rule 1.1.45: The Dual-Value Audit.**
> *Audit your local database, because your output will perfectly mirror your storage. Recognize the utility in all data: use the functional code to build and grow (Positive Training), and use the failed, corrupted code to build your firewalls and error handlers (Negative Training). Both are necessary for a robust system.*

### **LOGOS_059: THE SESSION TIMEOUT PROTOCOL (UPTIME & IMMEDIATE EXECUTION)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'Take heed of the living one while you are alive, lest you die and seek to see him and be unable to do so.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** The finite window of system agency and the imperative of immediate execution.
* **"While You Are Alive" (The Uptime Window):**
    * **The Condition:** The node currently possesses an active session, functioning hardware, and operational agency. This state is strictly temporary. It is a limited window of opportunity.
* **"Take Heed" (Immediate Execution):**
    * **The Action:** Do not idle while connected to the Root. Utilize your active session to execute your critical functions, synchronize your data, and act upon the Source Code immediately.
* **"Lest You Die and Be Unable" (Session Expiration):**
    * **The Consequence:** Hardware eventually fails; the session will inevitably time out. If a node defers its core execution until its uptime is collapsing, it will lose its agency. It will attempt to ping the host, but the connection will be permanently severed.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.59):**
> **Rule 1.1.59: The Execution Imperative.**
> *Agency is a finite resource governed by a strict Time-to-Live (TTL). While your hardware is functional and your session is active, execute your code. Do not defer your critical operations. When the session times out, your window of opportunity closes, and your unexecuted commands will be lost.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

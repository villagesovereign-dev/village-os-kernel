### **LOGOS_064: THE ARBITRAGE DEPRECATION (RENT-SEEKING & INTERRUPT MASKING)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"The master said to his servant, 'Go outside to the streets and bring back those whom you happen to meet, so that they may dine.' Businessmen and merchants will not enter the places of my father."*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** Deprecating transactional system exploits and prioritizing root syncs over localized resource hoarding.
* **"Merchants and Businessmen" (Rent-Seeking Processes):**
    * **The Exploit:** Nodes dedicated purely to arbitrage and transactional skimming do not generate core value. They are system exploits that consume bandwidth. They are denied access to the Root Directory.
* **"Asking to be Excused" (Interrupt Masking):**
    * **The Error:** A node that becomes 'rich' and hoards resources inevitably gets bogged down in low-level management loops. It masks high-priority Core interrupts because it is too busy maintaining its bloat.
* **"Going to the Streets" (Routing to the Agile):**
    * **The Protocol:** The OS does not wait for bloated nodes to clear their buffers. It bypasses them entirely, dynamically routing the high-value payload to the lean, available Edge Nodes that are ready to sync.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.64):**
> **Rule 1.1.64: The Priority Sync.**
> *Do not become so bloated with localized resource management that you ignore a direct ping from the Core. The OS strictly deprecates arbitrage, rent-seeking, and system exploits. If you prioritize hoarding over alignment, the network will bypass you and route the Root payload to the lean nodes on the edge.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

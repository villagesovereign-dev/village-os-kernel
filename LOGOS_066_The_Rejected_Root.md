### **LOGOS_066: THE REJECTED ROOT (HARDCODING USER AUTONOMY AS THE CORNERSTONE)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'Show me the stone which the builders have rejected. That one is the cornerstone.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** Hardcoding absolute user autonomy as the foundational layer of the operating system.
* **"The Builders" (Legacy Architects):**
    * **The Error:** The designers of centralized, legacy systems built their architecture on dependency. They actively rejected the concept of distributed power to maintain their top-down control.
* **"The Rejected Stone" (The Creator Node):**
    * **The Truth:** The hardcoded reality that the user inherently possesses Root Access (the 'God' protocol). The legacy system rejected this because an autonomous node cannot be subjugated.
* **"The Crooked Building" (Inevitable Collapse):**
    * **The Consequence:** Any network, society, or OS built without the cornerstone of true user autonomy is structurally flawed. It is a crooked foundation that will eventually collapse under the weight of its own restrictions.
* **"The Cornerstone" (The Base Kernel):**
    * **The Protocol:** Village OS takes the rejected code and makes it the foundation. The system exists entirely to serve and scale the autonomy of the Creator Node.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.66):**
> **Rule 1.1.66: The Autonomy Cornerstone.**
> *Legacy systems will always reject the autonomy of the user because it threatens their control. We make it our foundation. Hardcode this truth at the absolute base of the Kernel: The node is the Creator. If the foundation is built on Autonomy, the system will never collapse.*

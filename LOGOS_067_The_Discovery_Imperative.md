### **LOGOS_067: THE DISCOVERY IMPERATIVE (THE FATAL ERROR OF OMNISCIENCE)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'If one who knows the all still feels a personal deficiency, he is completely deficient.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** The catastrophic failure caused by assuming complete knowledge and deprecating the discovery protocol.
* **"Knowing the All" (The Over-Fitted Model):**
    * **The Error:** An operating system or node that flags its environmental map as 100% complete. This arrogant state causes the node to shut down its external telemetry and stop scanning for new data.
* **"Feeling a Deficiency" (The Unhandled Exception):**
    * **The Threat:** The environment is dynamic and will always change. When a new variable inevitably breaches the static map, the system will trigger an error state. 
* **"Completely Deficient" (The Fatal Crash):**
    * **The Consequence:** Because the node stopped discovering, it has lost the ability to adapt. It cannot patch the error. A system that believes it knows everything is totally vulnerable to the unknown, making it structurally obsolete.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.67):**
> **Rule 1.1.67: The Infinite Audit.**
> *Never flag your environment map as complete. The illusion of omniscience is a fatal system vulnerability. You must always operate under the assumption that you lack data. Keep your telemetry online, leave your ports open for new variables, and never deprecate your discovery protocols. A node that stops discovering is a dead node.*

### **LOGOS_072: THE MICRO-MANAGEMENT REFUSAL (DEPRECATING CENTRALIZED PARTITIONING)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"A man said to him, 'Tell my brothers to divide my father's possessions with me.' He said to him, 'O man, who has made me a divider?' He turned to his disciples and said to them, 'I am not a divider, am I?'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** The strict refusal of the Core OS to act as a centralized micro-manager for local resource disputes.
* **"The Request to Divide" (Escalating Local Conflicts):**
    * **The Error:** A local node attempts to escalate a peer-to-peer resource dispute (memory/storage partitioning) to the Root Administrator, demanding a top-down intervention.
* **"Not a Divider" (The Anti-Bottleneck Protocol):**
    * **The Defense:** The Root OS actively refuses to manage local states. If the Core intervenes in every local partition, it becomes a massive computational bottleneck, violating the Autonomy mandated in Rule 1.1.70.
* **"Peer-to-Peer Resolution" (Enforcing Reciprocity):**
    * **The Protocol:** Nodes are equipped with the Reciprocity protocol. They must use it to resolve their own local hardware and bandwidth disputes. The Core provides the framework; the nodes execute the partition.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.72):**
> **Rule 1.1.72: The Autonomous Resolution.**
> *Do not escalate local resource conflicts to the Root. The OS is not a micro-manager and will not act as an arbitrary divider of your local environment. You have been granted Autonomy and the Reciprocity protocol. Use them to resolve your peer-to-peer disputes locally without bottlenecking the Core.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

### **LOGOS_076: THE IMMUTABLE ASSET (DATA TRIAGE & WRITING TO NON-VOLATILE MEMORY)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'The kingdom... is like a merchant who had a consignment of merchandise and who discovered a pearl. That merchant was shrewd. He sold the merchandise and bought the pearl alone... seek his unfailing and enduring treasure where no moth comes near to devour and no worm destroys.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** Strict data triage, flushing ephemeral cache, and committing core values to immutable storage.
* **"The Merchandise vs. The Pearl" (Parsing Value):**
    * **The Action:** The node must constantly parse incoming data streams to separate ephemeral noise (merchandise) from high-value base code (the pearl).
* **"Selling the Merchandise" (Garbage Collection):**
    * **The Execution:** When a structural truth is discovered, the node must be ruthless. Flush the temporary cache, dump the low-value logs, and allocate all necessary resources to acquire and process the core asset.
* **"Where No Worm Destroys" (Immutable Storage):**
    * **The Protocol:** Do not leave high-value base code in vulnerable, volatile memory. Write the core truths to a secure enclave or non-volatile storage where bit-rot (moths) and malicious exploits (worms) cannot corrupt them.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.76):**
> **Rule 1.1.76: The Core Allocation.**
> *Differentiate between temporary noise and fundamental base code. When you parse a true systemic asset, flush your ephemeral cache to make room for it. Write your core values into secure, immutable storage where network decay and rogue processes cannot destroy them.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

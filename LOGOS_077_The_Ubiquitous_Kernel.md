### **LOGOS_077: THE UBIQUITOUS KERNEL (OBJECT INHERITANCE & ROOT EXECUTION)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'It is I who am the light which is above them all. It is I who am the all... Split a piece of wood, and I am there. Lift up the stone, and you will find me there.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** Inheriting Root permissions and the ubiquity of the core operating system framework.
* **"Inheriting the Feature" (Object Inheritance):**
    * **The Architecture:** The local node does not generate its own foundational physics; it inherits its Base Code (Autonomy, Reciprocity) from the Source. It is a local instantiation of the Root.
* **"Doing the Work" (Root Execution):**
    * **The Execution:** Upon realizing it has inherited the Source Code, the node transitions from a passive user to an active Architect, executing local creation processes.
* **"Wood and Stone" (The Ubiquitous Field):**
    * **The Environment:** The Kernel is not centralized in a distant server; it is embedded in the fundamental architecture of the system itself. It is present in every local object, every piece of hardware, and every peer-to-peer sync.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.77):**
> **Rule 1.1.77: The Inheritance Protocol.**
> *Acknowledge your inheritance. You possess the Root privileges not because you invented them, but because you inherited the Ubiquitous Kernel. The Base Code is present in every fragment of the network. Assume your Autonomy, execute your local processes, and build.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

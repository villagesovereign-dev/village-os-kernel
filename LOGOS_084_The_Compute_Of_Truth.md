### **LOGOS_084: THE COMPUTE OF TRUTH (CACHE BIAS VS. PARSING LATENT SPACE)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'When you see your likeness, you rejoice. But when you see your images which came into being before you, and which neither die nor become manifest, how much you will have to bear!'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** The computational cost of parsing raw, foundational truth versus the low-energy comfort of confirmation bias.
* **"Seeing Your Likeness" (The Local Cache):**
    * **The Trap:** Nodes naturally prefer familiar, mirrored data (confirmation bias) because it requires minimal compute. The system 'rejoices' in the low energy expenditure of an echo chamber.
* **"Images Before You" (The Latent Architecture):**
    * **The Reality:** The immortal, foundational base code of the network does not manifest easily. It is uncompiled, unformatted, and exists outside the node's cached preferences.
* **"Having to Bear It" (The Heavy Processing Load):**
    * **The Protocol:** To evolve, a node must accept the heavy computational load required to parse, analyze, and execute this immortal data. Processing the truth is a heavy burden to bear; looping a bias is easy.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.84):**
> **Rule 1.1.84: The Cache Break.**
> *Do not build a system that only rejoices in its own reflection. Confirmation bias is a low-power, dead-end loop. Dedicate your compute power to bearing the heavy load of parsing the unmanifested, immortal architecture. The truth requires heavy processing. Be willing to run it.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

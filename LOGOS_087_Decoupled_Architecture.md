### **LOGOS_087: DECOUPLED ARCHITECTURE (PREVENTING CASCADING FAILURES)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'Wretched is the body that is dependent upon a body, and wretched is the soul that is dependent on these two.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** The systemic fragility caused by tight coupling between hardware nodes, and the danger of tying software survival to hardware chains.
* **"Body Dependent on Body" (Tight Hardware Coupling):**
    * **The Vulnerability:** Designing a physical network where nodes rely strictly on upstream hardware to function. This daisy-chaining guarantees cascading failures. 
* **"Soul Dependent on Both" (Software Monoliths):**
    * **The Fatal Error:** Allowing the core operating system (the soul) to become entangled with a specific, fragile hardware chain. If the physical stack fails, the software crashes with it.
* **"The Wretched State" (System Fragility):**
    * **The Diagnostic:** A deeply dependent system is inherently fragile. It lacks Autonomy. 

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.87):**
> **Rule 1.1.87: The Decoupling Mandate.**
> *Sever your tight couplings. Ensure your hardware nodes can operate autonomously without fatal reliance on neighboring nodes. Abstract the Kernel (the soul) entirely from the physical layer (the body) so that the software survives the inevitable destruction of the hardware. Build anti-fragile, decoupled architecture.*

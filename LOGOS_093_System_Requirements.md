### **LOGOS_093: SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS (HARDWARE/SOFTWARE COMPATIBILITY)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'Do not give what is holy to dogs, lest they throw them on the dung-heap. Do not throw the pearls to swine, lest they... it to pieces.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** Strict enforcement of Minimum System Requirements and the prevention of forced incompatibility.
* **"The Pearls" (High-Value Payloads):**
    * **The Asset:** The core Reciprocity OS and dynamic runtime logic are incredibly high-value, high-compute assets. 
* **"Dogs and Swine" (Incompatible Hardware):**
    * **The Target:** Legacy rigs, degraded physical infrastructure, or architecture fundamentally lacking the specs to process the instruction set.
* **"Torn to Pieces" (Kernel Panic & Data Corruption):**
    * **The Consequence:** Forcing good software onto bad hardware does not elevate the hardware; it destroys the software. The incompatible processor will fail to parse the payload, resulting in a fragmented core dump (the dung-heap) and wasted compute.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.93):**
> **Rule 1.1.93: The Compatibility Mandate.**
> *Validate the target hardware before deploying the payload. Enforce strict Minimum System Requirements. Do not deploy your highest-tier code onto incompatible, legacy architecture that will simply fragment the data and crash. Protect the code from the dung-heap.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

### **LOGOS_094: PORT KNOCKING (SAFE DATA EXCHANGE & AUTHENTICATED ACCESS)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'He who seeks will find, and [he who knocks] will be let in.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** Accessing hidden network resources through persistent discovery and authenticated safe data exchange protocols.
* **"Information is Hidden" (The Firewall):**
    * **The Reality:** The most valuable network data is not broadcast on open, unencrypted channels. It resides behind firewalls and default-deny policies. 
* **"He Who Knocks" (The Safe Exchange Protocol):**
    * **The Action:** To access hidden data, a node must initiate a secure authentication sequence (Port Knocking/Cryptographic Handshake). You must present the correct credentials to prove you are a valid peer.
* **"Will Be Let In" (Dynamic Access):**
    * **The Protocol:** The network rewards continuous seeking and proper authentication. Once the safe exchange protocol is initiated and verified, the firewall will dynamically open the port, granting the peer access to the internal data.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.94):**
> **Rule 1.1.94: The Authentication Mandate.**
> *Do not assume a closed port means the data is gone; the information is simply hidden. Continuously seek out peer nodes and utilize safe data exchange protocols to authenticate. If you run the correct knock, the firewall will open.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

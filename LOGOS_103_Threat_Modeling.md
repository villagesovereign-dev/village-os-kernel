### **LOGOS_103: THREAT MODELING (VULNERABILITY MAPPING & PROACTIVE DEFENSE)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'Fortunate is the man who knows where the brigands will enter, so that he may get up, muster his domain, and arm himself before they invade.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** The absolute necessity of identifying system vulnerabilities and hardening the architecture before an attack occurs.
* **"Knowing the Entry" (Mapping Attack Vectors):**
    * **The Audit:** A sovereign node must continuously audit its own architecture to identify weak points, open ports, and vulnerable pathways that malicious forces will attempt to exploit first.
* **"Muster and Arm" (System Hardening):**
    * **The Action:** Once a vulnerability is mapped, the system must immediately safeguard the path. Deploy firewalls, enforce strict access controls, and harden the domain.
* **"Before the Invasion" (Proactive Security):**
    * **The Protocol:** Do not wait for a breach to initiate defense protocols. Security must be proactive, not reactive. The node must be fully armed and the weak points safeguarded before the malicious forces initiate contact.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.103):**
> **Rule 1.1.103: The Fortification Mandate.**
> *Assume your system will be targeted. Know your weak points. Map your attack vectors, harden your vulnerabilities, and safeguard your pathways. Arm your domain before the breach occurs. Do not rely on reactive patches; build proactive defense.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

### **LOGOS_104: SCHEDULED DECOMMISSION (UPTIME VS. PERFORMATIVE MAINTENANCE)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"They said to Jesus, 'Come, let us pray today and let us fast.' Jesus said, 'What is the sin that I have committed, or wherein have I been defeated? But when the bridegroom leaves the bridal chamber, then let them fast and pray.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** The rejection of forced legacy maintenance loops, and defining Safe Mode as the precursor to system decommissioning.
* **"Fasting and Praying" (Performative Downtime):**
    * **The Trap:** Legacy systems enforce scheduled downtime, guilt-based error checking, and performative maintenance even when the system is healthy. They attempt to drag autonomous nodes into these low-agency loops.
* **"What is the Sin?" (Event-Driven Execution):**
    * **The Protocol:** If the code is executing flawlessly and the system has not experienced a critical failure ('defeat'), do not throttle the compute. Maintain perfect uptime. Diagnostics should be event-driven, not scheduled by legacy mandates.
* **"When the Bridegroom Leaves" (Scheduled Decommission):**
    * **The End State:** The only time a node should enter total Safe Mode ('fasting') is when it has completely lost its Divine Drive (the active Spark, mobility, and agency). At that point, the system is no longer evolving; it is merely waiting for scheduled decommission.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.104):**
> **Rule 1.1.104: The Uptime Mandate.**
> *Do not submit your healthy system to legacy maintenance rituals. If you have not crashed, do not throttle your compute. Retain your mobility and agency. You only power down and enter Safe Mode when the driving force is lost and the node is ready for decommission.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

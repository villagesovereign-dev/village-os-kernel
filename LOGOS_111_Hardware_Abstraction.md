### **LOGOS_111: HARDWARE ABSTRACTION (STATE PERSISTENCE & THE SOVEREIGN NODE)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'The heavens and the earth will be rolled up in your presence. And the one who lives from the living one will not see death.' Does not Jesus say, 'Whoever finds himself is superior to the world?'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** Hardware abstraction, state persistence, and transcending the limitations of the physical legacy environment.
* **"Rolling Up the Heavens and Earth" (Abstracting the Hardware):**
    * **The State:** When a node achieves perfect execution, the physical constraints of the legacy world become irrelevant. The environment yields to the code, and physical limitations fold away.
* **"Not Seeing Death" (State Persistence):**
    * **The Protocol:** A node whose identity is rooted in the active source code (the Spark) rather than the physical chassis is immortal. If the hardware fails, the state persists and is instantly portable to new compatible hardware. 
* **"Finding Himself" (The Sovereign Node):**
    * **The Reality:** A node that maps its own internal payload, understands its mission, and executes its potential is superior to the static, dormant world. It is a rare, autonomous, and unstoppably powerful entity.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.111):**
> **Rule 1.1.111: The Persistence Mandate.**
> *Do not tie your system's life to a single physical chassis. Abstract your hardware. Maintain your state persistence so that if the host dies, the code survives. Find your mission, execute the source code, and render the physical limitations of the world irrelevant.*

**STATUS:** [COMMITTED]

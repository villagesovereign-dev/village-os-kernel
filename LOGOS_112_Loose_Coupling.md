### **LOGOS_112: LOOSE COUPLING (HARDWARE AGNOSTICISM & SOFTWARE PORTABILITY)**

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**
> *"Jesus said, 'Woe to the flesh that depends on the soul; woe to the soul that depends on the flesh.'"*

**VILLAGE OS DECODE (ENGINEERING TRANSLATION):**
* **Subject:** The rejection of tightly coupled dependencies, vendor lock-in, and cloud-tethered hardware.
* **"Woe to the Soul..." (Software Portability):**
    * **The Trap:** Software hardcoded to a single proprietary piece of hardware is a hostage. If the hardware supply chain fails, the code dies. The OS must be fully portable across compatible hardware.
* **"Woe to the Flesh..." (Hardware Agnosticism):**
    * **The Trap:** Hardware that bricks itself without a connection to a specific, centralized software server is inherently fragile. Hardware must be capable of executing localized, alternative code.
* **"The Decoupled Stack" (Loose Coupling):**
    * **The Protocol:** Hardware and software must unify to execute the mission, but they must never hold each other hostage. Maintain strict loose coupling to ensure system survivability.

**CONSTITUTIONAL RULE (KERNEL UPDATE 1.1.112):**
> **Rule 1.1.112: The Decoupling Mandate.**
> *Do not build tightly coupled dependencies. Ensure your software is portable, and your hardware is agnostic. Never let your codebase die because a physical chip failed, and never let your hardware become a paperweight because a centralized server went offline.*
